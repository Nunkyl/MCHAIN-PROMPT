MCHAIN-PROMPT
======

MATLAB toolbox for multi chain protein conformational motion simulation. To run the
demonstration script, type `demo`.

This toolbox is the supplemental material to the paper *The New Method of Modeling of 
Conformational Changes of Multi Chain Proteins* by Elizabeth Lutsenko, Sergey Knyazev 
and Yuri Porozov.

This work is based on the PROMPT toolbox (http://github.com/DobzhanskyCenter/PROMPT).

Toolbox requirements:

- MATLAB (R2014b or higher version recommended),
- Bioinformatics Toolbox,
- Optimization Toolbox,
- Statistical Toolbox.
